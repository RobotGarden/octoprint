= What is Octoprint?


Octoprint is a web interface for a 3D printer. Octoprint makes it easy
to use a 3D printer. It is FOSSware or free open source software.

= Authenticated v. Unauthenticated

If you have not authenticated (logged in), your abilities with Octoprint
will be limited. You can:

* Observe but not set bed and nozzle temperatures from the temperature tab.
* Observe the printer but not control the x,y,z access of the printhead from the control tab.
* The ‘GCode’ tab functionality is the same since it is effectively read only.
* The terminal tab will still reflect the exchange of G-Code and response, 
but you will not be able to send adhoc G-Code to the printer unless authenticated.
* The timelapse tab will allow you to download data, but you will not
be able to upload, slice or print a file.

= The process

The process for printing a file can be quite easy. The directions are
found in the next 5 sections. If you are already logged in and connected
to the printer, it becomes a 3 step process: upload, slice and print.

* Login
* Connect to the printer
* Upload a File
* Slice a File
* Print a File

== Login

image::login.jpg[Login]

You must login/be authenticated to print. 
Click the login button at the top right of the screen. 
Fill out the *username* and *password*, then press the *Login* button.  
If you don’t know the username or password, see a Marshal.

== Connect to the Printer

image::connect_to_printer.jpg[Connect to printer]

Connection is controlled by the connection popdown, at the top left of the screen. Values:
[%hardbreaks]
 * *Serial Port*: /dev/ttyACM0
 * *Baud Rate*: 250000. That’s 250,000 but with no comma.
 * *Printer Profile*: Fill in and correct image
 * *Save and Auto-connect*: you can check these if so desired.
 * *Connect button*: when these are set appropriately, press connect.

For troubleshooting, see 
https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#i-cant-get-octoprint-to-connect-to-my-printer[Octoprint’s documentation]
as well.

== Upload a File

image::upload_file.jpg[Upload a file]

To perform operations related to printing you must be authenticated (logged in). 
You can only upload pass:q[<u>*STL*</u>] or pass:q[<u>*G-Code*</u>] files. Typically STL files have the extension pass:q[<u>*.stl*</u>] and G-code files 
have either the pass:q[<u>*.gco*</u>] or pass:q[<u>*.gcode*</u>] extension. 
Click one of the upload buttons found on the left of the screen - see image below. 
pass:q[<u>*Upload*</u>] transfers the file to the Pi, while pass:q[<u>*Upload to SD*</u>] transfers the file to the printer’s SD card. 

Alternately you can drag and drop a file to the browser screen. 
[%hardbreaks]
 * Dropping on the left transfers the file to the Pi 
 * Dropping on the right transfers the file to the printer’s SD card.

You can also download files from the list of files if you’d like.

== Slice a File
image::slice_a_file.jpg[Upload a file]
[%hardbreaks]
Slicing turns STL files into G-Code files. 
If you have a previously sliced G-Code file and have already uploaded the file you can skip this step. 

To slice a file in Octoprint, click the magic wand tool to bring up the pass:q[<u>*slicing dialog*</u>].
image::pick_slicing_profile.jpg[Upload a file]

 * Select the Slicer. Currently we ONLY have the CuraEngine installed to slice the model.
 * Select the profile. Profiles are a collection of settings for the given slicer. We’ve named them for *filament material*, *quality* and whether they provide *lattice support*. 
 ** *Filament material* is the actual type of material used to print the part. Among other considerations, this controls head and bed temperature and it is important to pick the correct one.
 ** The *quality* will control how much infill or how dense the print is. Most parts will do fine with fast (low in fill) or medium (~50% infill). 
 ** *Lattice Support* is used to allow hollow spaces or overhangs greater than a 60 degree angle to be printed successfully.
 * *Printer profile* should default correctly as we are connecting to a single printer.
 * *GCode Filename* is the name of the file once slicing is complete. It is a good idea to include some indication of *filament material*, *quality* and *lattice support* in the name so that in the future you will know what that is.
 * *After Slicing...* Options include: can do nothing, load the file for printing and even start the print. This example will assume we picked *Do nothing*.


== Print a File
image::print_a_file.jpg[Upload a file]
[%hardbreaks]
Once you have a G-Code file you are ready to print. Click the folder icon to load the file or the printer icon to load AND print the file immediately.

= The Tabs

The tab section of the screen gives you fast access to basic printer
control, monitoring and video recording. In addition, some plugins add
to this list and are reached using the widget on the right side of the
tab rack.

Also, no matter which tab you navigate to, you will have access to the
left panel where you can upload, slice and print files as well as
control whether the machine is connected.

== System

Sometimes it is necessary to restart or shutdown if things are not
working as expected.  Restarting and shutting down Octoprint is done
through the System menu.  There are 3 options:

1.  Restart OctoPrint - This does not restart the entire system, instead
it just restarts the services that Octoprint uses to host the
application.
2.  Reboot - This will restart the entire Raspberry Pi and reset the
operating system as well as Octoprint
3.  Shutdown - This will turn the Raspberry Pi off completely

Tips and tricks
---------------

1.  The Rostock bed heats up slowly. It is a good idea to set the
temperature from the temperature tab. Select the temperature appropriate
for the material.

1.  Octoprint is quite capable. It’s worth spending some time to
understand and experiment with the settings.
2.  Octoprint’s interface is sometimes a little slow and bad at
refreshing content.  Refresh your browser page if you appear to randomly
lose access.
3.  When two or more people try to manage the printer simultaneously,
Octoprint does not do a good job of knowing which person has the
control.  Ensure you are not attempting to simultaneously control the
printer when someone else is using it.
4.  If you want to capture timelapse pictures of your print for review
later, you must set the timelapse before you start your print.
5.  The Terminal tab can be very useful if you need to level the print
bed as you can issue commands to move the nozzle and check level at
various points across the bed.

Settings
--------

Warning: Settings is for more advanced users.  The average person can
skip this section.  

For those who wish to add profiles, control the printer settings, or add
advanced GCode processing, Settings is where these are handled.  There
are several configuration elements on the left side, they are as
follows:

1.  Printer Section: All things related to the printer itself
2.  Features: Control special features such as the webcam or connection
options
3.  Octoprint: Configurations for the Octoprint application itself
4.  Plugins: Additional management of plugins

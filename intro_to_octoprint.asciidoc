* Temperature and pre-heating the bed and nozzle
* Manual control of the printer
* Video monitor your print and video capture your prints
* Visualize your G-code
* System
* Tips and tricks
* Settings

What is Octoprint?
------------------

Octoprint is a web interface for a 3D printer. Octoprint makes it easy
to use a 3D printer. It is FOSSware or free open source software.

Authenticated v. Unauthenticated
--------------------------------

If you have not authenticated (logged in), your abilities with Octoprint
will be limited. You can:

* Observe but not set bed and nozzle temperatures from the temperature tab.
* Observe the printer but not control the x,y,z access of the printhead from the control tab.
* The ‘GCode’ tab functionality is the same since it is effectively read only.
* The terminal tab will still reflect the exchange of G-Code and response, 
but you will not be able to send adhoc G-Code to the printer unless authenticated.
* The timelapse tab will allow you to download data, but you will not
be able to upload, slice or print a file.

The process
-----------

The process for printing a file can be quite easy. The directions are
found in the next 5 sections. If you are already logged in and connected
to the printer, it becomes a 3 step process: upload, slice and print.

1.  Login
2.  Connect to the printer
3.  Upload a File
4.  Slice a File
5.  Print a File

The Tabs
--------

The tab section of the screen gives you fast access to basic printer
control, monitoring and video recording. In addition, some plugins add
to this list and are reached using the widget on the right side of the
tab rack.

Also, no matter which tab you navigate to, you will have access to the
left panel where you can upload, slice and print files as well as
control whether the machine is connected.

System
------

Sometimes it is necessary to restart or shutdown if things are not
working as expected.  Restarting and shutting down Octoprint is done
through the System menu.  There are 3 options:

1.  Restart OctoPrint - This does not restart the entire system, instead
it just restarts the services that Octoprint uses to host the
application.
2.  Reboot - This will restart the entire Raspberry Pi and reset the
operating system as well as Octoprint
3.  Shutdown - This will turn the Raspberry Pi off completely

Tips and tricks
---------------

1.  The Rostock bed heats up slowly. It is a good idea to set the
temperature from the temperature tab. Select the temperature appropriate
for the material.

1.  Octoprint is quite capable. It’s worth spending some time to
understand and experiment with the settings.
2.  Octoprint’s interface is sometimes a little slow and bad at
refreshing content.  Refresh your browser page if you appear to randomly
lose access.
3.  When two or more people try to manage the printer simultaneously,
Octoprint does not do a good job of knowing which person has the
control.  Ensure you are not attempting to simultaneously control the
printer when someone else is using it.
4.  If you want to capture timelapse pictures of your print for review
later, you must set the timelapse before you start your print.
5.  The Terminal tab can be very useful if you need to level the print
bed as you can issue commands to move the nozzle and check level at
various points across the bed.

Settings
--------

Warning: Settings is for more advanced users.  The average person can
skip this section.  

For those who wish to add profiles, control the printer settings, or add
advanced GCode processing, Settings is where these are handled.  There
are several configuration elements on the left side, they are as
follows:

1.  Printer Section: All things related to the printer itself
2.  Features: Control special features such as the webcam or connection
options
3.  Octoprint: Configurations for the Octoprint application itself
4.  Plugins: Additional management of plugins

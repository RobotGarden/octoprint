= Slicing Using CuraEngine

Octoprint uses link:https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine[CuraEngine] to slice STL files into GCode.
CuraEngine is a C++ rewrite of an older, Python-based Cura slicer. During the rewrite, all the settings
changed their names. Most front-ends to CuraEngine, like OctoPrint and Cura (the Cura GUI) still use the
older Cura `.ini` file format for their profiles and then convert on-the-fly to the newer CuraEngine JSON
format when calling CuraEngine.

Octoprint also uses JSON format for uploading and downloading slicer profiles from the web API. However,
that is a different JSON format from the one CuraEngine uses. Octoprint's JSON format is a pretty
straightforward translation of the Cura `.ini` format to JSON.

== Comparison of Cura and CuraEngine Settings

Note: units are units of CuraEngine setting, not necessarily the same as Cura `.ini` setting.
